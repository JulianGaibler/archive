    ðŸŽ‰ **5 years later, Archive hits 2.0.0!** ðŸŽ‰

    **The frontend has been completely rewritten**, moving from a single-page (SPA) to a multi-page application (MPA) architecture. **Password and session security has been enhanced**, with modern password hashing algorithms and fixed security issues around timing attacks.
    
    **Posts now support multiple items**, with additional functionality for merging posts and moving items between posts. Items within posts can also be reordered as needed. **Collections have been removed** since nobody was using them.
